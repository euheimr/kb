In "File Search", you can tick "Regular expressions" and use this regex to search for "some text" but exclude one-line (ie // ...) java comments:

^(?!\s*//).*some text


This regex will also exclude all lines whose first character is * - ie javadoc comments:

^(?!\s*(//|\*)).*some text

While lines that start with * are not necessarily comments, it is rare indeed for java code.
